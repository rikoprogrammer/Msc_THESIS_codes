# R codes

This repository contains R scripts that I used to conduct analysis for my thesis.

We have a separate script for data preparation called ```data_manager.R``` and another script for conducting the analyses called ```thesisv2.Rmd``` which contains the R codes and some little prose explaining what the various sections of code do.

The detailed write up for the thesis was done using ```latex``` and can be found online at https://www.overleaf.com/project/67e61ca45e86bac92a082abf
